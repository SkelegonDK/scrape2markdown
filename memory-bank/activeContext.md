# Active Context: Scrape2Markdown

## Current Focus
The project is currently focused on streamlining and enhancing the core URL processing and markdown conversion functionality.

## Recent Changes

### [2/3/2025] Streamlined Core Functionality
- Improved clipboard operations
  - Replaced JavaScript clipboard with pyperclip
  - Added error handling for clipboard operations
- UI Organization
  - Moved download button to sidebar
  - Improved section headers
  - Enhanced filtering options

### [2/1/2025] Core Feature Separation
- Removed chat/AI functionality
  - Focused solely on HTML to markdown conversion
  - Simplified user interface
  - Enhanced core conversion capabilities
- Added clipboard functionality
- Maintained download feature with timestamps

## Active Decisions

### 1. UI/UX
- Two-column layout chosen for optimal workflow
- Sidebar contains all management controls
- Main area dedicated to preview
- Real-time updates for immediate feedback

### 2. Content Processing
- Default filter elements defined for common non-content HTML tags
- Class-based filtering with multiselect
- Element-based filtering with multiselect
- Combined markdown preview

### 3. Export Options
- Clipboard operations through pyperclip
- File downloads with timestamps
- Clean markdown export (URL headers removed)

## Current Challenges

### URL Processing
- Need for improved URL validation
- Context-aware URL selection pending
- Link-based URL discovery planned

### Content Enhancement
