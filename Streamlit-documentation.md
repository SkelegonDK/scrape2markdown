Build an LLM app using LangChain
================================

OpenAI, LangChain, and Streamlit in 18 lines of code
----------------------------------------------------

In this tutorial, you will build a Streamlit LLM app that can generate text from a user-provided prompt. This Python app will use the LangChain framework and Streamlit. Optionally, you can deploy your app to [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) when you're done.

*This tutorial is adapted from a blog post by Chanin Nantesanamat: [LangChain tutorial #1: Build an LLM-powered app in 18 lines of code](https://blog.streamlit.io/langchain-tutorial-1-build-an-llm-powered-app-in-18-lines-of-code/).*

[Built with Streamlit ðŸŽˆ](https://streamlit.io)[Fullscreen *open\_in\_new*](https://doc-tutorial-llm-18-lines-of-code.streamlit.app/?utm_medium=oembed)

Objectives
----------

1. Get an OpenAI key from the end user.
2. Validate the user's OpenAI key.
3. Get a text prompt from the user.
4. Authenticate OpenAI with the user's key.
5. Send the user's prompt to OpenAI's API.
6. Get a response and display it.

Bonus: Deploy the app on Streamlit Community Cloud!

Prerequisites
-------------

* Python 3.9+
* Streamlit
* LangChain
* [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys?ref=blog.streamlit.io)

Setup coding environment
------------------------

In your IDE (integrated coding environment), open the terminal and install the following two Python libraries:

`pip install streamlit langchain-openai`

Create a `requirements.txt` file located in the root of your working directory and save these dependencies. This is necessary for deploying the app to the Streamlit Community Cloud later.

`streamlit
openai
langchain`

Building the app
----------------

The app is only 18 lines of code:

`import streamlit as st
from langchain_openai.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
st.title("ðŸ¦œðŸ”— Quickstart App")
openai_api_key = st.sidebar.text_input("OpenAI API Key", type="password")
def generate_response(input_text):
model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.7, api_key=openai_api_key)
st.info(model.invoke(input_text))
with st.form("my_form"):
text = st.text_area(
"Enter text:",
"What are the three key pieces of advice for learning how to code?",
)
submitted = st.form_submit_button("Submit")
if not openai_api_key.startswith("sk-"):
st.warning("Please enter your OpenAI API key!", icon="âš ")
if submitted and openai_api_key.startswith("sk-"):
generate_response(text)`

To start, create a new Python file and save it asÂ `streamlit_app.py` in the root of your working directory.

1. Import the necessary Python libraries.
   
   `import streamlit as st
   from langchain_openai.chat_models import ChatOpenAI`
2. Create the app's title using `st.title`.
   
   `st.title("ðŸ¦œðŸ”— Quickstart App")`
3. Add a text input box for the user to enter their OpenAI API key.
   
   `openai_api_key = st.sidebar.text_input("OpenAI API Key", type="password")`
4. Define a function to authenticate to OpenAI API with the user's key, send a prompt, and get an AI-generated response. This function accepts the user's prompt as an argument and displays the AI-generated response in a blue box using `st.info`.
   
   `def generate_response(input_text):
   model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.7, api_key=openai_api_key)
   st.info(model.invoke(input_text))`
5. Finally, use `st.form()` to create a text box (`st.text_area()`) for user input. When the user clicks `Submit`, the `generate-response()` function is called with the user's input as an argument.
   
   `with st.form("my_form"):
   text = st.text_area(
   "Enter text:",
   "What are the three key pieces of advice for learning how to code?",
   )
   submitted = st.form_submit_button("Submit")
   if not openai_api_key.startswith("sk-"):
   st.warning("Please enter your OpenAI API key!", icon="âš ")
   if submitted and openai_api_key.startswith("sk-"):
   generate_response(text)`
6. Remember to save your file!
7. Return to your computer's terminal to run the app.
   
   `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`

Deploying the app
-----------------

To deploy the app to the Streamlit Cloud, follow these steps:

1. Create a GitHub repository for the app. Your repository should contain two files:
   
   `your-repository/
   â”œâ”€â”€ streamlit_app.py
   â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt`
2. Go to [Streamlit Community Cloud](http://share.streamlit.io), click theÂ `New app`Â button from your workspace, then specify the repository, branch, and main file path. Optionally, you can customize your app's URL by choosing a custom subdomain.
3. Click theÂ `Deploy!`Â button.

Your app will now be deployed to Streamlit Community Cloud and can be accessed from around the world! ðŸŒŽ

Conclusion
----------

Congratulations on building an LLM-powered Streamlit app in 18 lines of code! ðŸ¥³ You can use this app to generate text from any prompt that you provide. The app is limited by the capabilities of the OpenAI LLM, but it can still be used to generate some creative and interesting text.

We hope you found this tutorial helpful! Check out [more examples](https://streamlit.io/generative-ai) to see the power of Streamlit and LLM. ðŸ’–

Happy Streamlit-ing! ðŸŽˆ

Build a basic LLM chat app
==========================

Introduction
------------

The advent of large language models like GPT has revolutionized the ease of developing chat-based applications. Streamlit offers several [Chat elements](/develop/api-reference/chat), enabling you to build Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) for conversational agents or chatbots. Leveraging [session state](/develop/concepts/architecture/session-state) along with these elements allows you to construct anything from a basic chatbot to a more advanced, ChatGPT-like experience using purely Python code.

In this tutorial, we'll start by walking through Streamlit's chat elements, `st.chat_message` and `st.chat_input`. Then we'll proceed to construct three distinct applications, each showcasing an increasing level of complexity and functionality:

1. First, we'll [Build a bot that mirrors your input](#build-a-bot-that-mirrors-your-input) to get a feel for the chat elements and how they work. We'll also introduce [session state](/develop/concepts/architecture/session-state) and how it can be used to store the chat history. This section will serve as a foundation for the rest of the tutorial.
2. Next, you'll learn how to [Build a simple chatbot GUI with streaming](#build-a-simple-chatbot-gui-with-streaming).
3. Finally, we'll [Build a ChatGPT-like app](#build-a-chatgpt-like-app) that leverages session state to remember conversational context, all within less than 50 lines of code.

Here's a sneak peek of the LLM-powered chatbot GUI with streaming we'll build in this tutorial:

[Built with Streamlit ðŸŽˆ](https://streamlit.io)[Fullscreen *open\_in\_new*](https://doc-chat-llm.streamlit.app/?utm_medium=oembed)

Play around with the above demo to get a feel for what we'll build in this tutorial. A few things to note:

* There's a chat input at the bottom of the screen that's always visible. It contains some placeholder text. You can type in a message and press Enter or click the run button to send it.
* When you enter a message, it appears as a chat message in the container above. The container is scrollable, so you can scroll up to see previous messages. A default avatar is displayed to your messages' left.
* The assistant's responses are streamed to the frontend and are displayed with a different default avatar.

Before we start building, let's take a closer look at the chat elements we'll use.

Chat elements
-------------

Streamlit offers several commands to help you build conversational apps. These chat elements are designed to be used in conjunction with each other, but you can also use them separately.

[`st.chat_message`](/develop/api-reference/chat/st.chat_message) lets you insert a chat message container into the app so you can display messages from the user or the app. Chat containers can contain other Streamlit elements, including charts, tables, text, and more. [`st.chat_input`](/develop/api-reference/chat/st.chat_input) lets you display a chat input widget so the user can type in a message.

For an overview of the API, check out this video tutorial by Chanin Nantasenamat ([@dataprofessor](https://www.youtube.com/dataprofessor)), a Senior Developer Advocate at Streamlit.


### st.chat\_message

`st.chat_message` lets you insert a multi-element chat message container into your app. The returned container can contain any Streamlit element, including charts, tables, text, and more. To add elements to the returned container, you can use `with` notation.

`st.chat_message`'s first parameter is the `name` of the message author, which can be either `"user"` or `"assistant"` to enable preset styling and avatars, like in the demo above. You can also pass in a custom string to use as the author name. Currently, the name is not shown in the UI but is only set as an accessibility label. For accessibility reasons, you should not use an empty string.

Here's an minimal example of how to use `st.chat_message` to display a welcome message:

`import streamlit as st
with st.chat_message("user"):
st.write("Hello ðŸ‘‹")`
![](/images/knowledge-base/chat-message-hello.png)
  

Notice the message is displayed with a default avatar and styling since we passed in `"user"` as the author name. You can also pass in `"assistant"` as the author name to use a different default avatar and styling, or pass in a custom name and avatar. See the [API reference](/develop/api-reference/chat/st.chat_message) for more details.

`import streamlit as st
import numpy as np
with st.chat_message("assistant"):
st.write("Hello human")
st.bar_chart(np.random.randn(30, 3))`
[Built with Streamlit ðŸŽˆ](https://streamlit.io)[Fullscreen *open\_in\_new*](https://doc-chat-message-user1.streamlit.app/?utm_medium=oembed)

While we've used the preferred `with` notation in the above examples, you can also just call methods directly in the returned objects. The below example is equivalent to the one above:

`import streamlit as st
import numpy as np
message = st.chat_message("assistant")
message.write("Hello human")
message.bar_chart(np.random.randn(30, 3))`

So far, we've displayed predefined messages. But what if we want to display messages based on user input?

### st.chat\_input

`st.chat_input` lets you display a chat input widget so the user can type in a message. The returned value is the user's input, which is `None` if the user hasn't sent a message yet. You can also pass in a default prompt to display in the input widget. Here's an example of how to use `st.chat_input` to display a chat input widget and show the user's input:

`import streamlit as st
prompt = st.chat_input("Say something")
if prompt:
st.write(f"User has sent the following prompt: {prompt}")`
[Built with Streamlit ðŸŽˆ](https://streamlit.io)[Fullscreen *open\_in\_new*](https://doc-chat-input.streamlit.app/?utm_medium=oembed)

Pretty straightforward, right? Now let's combine `st.chat_message` and `st.chat_input` to build a bot the mirrors or echoes your input.

Build a bot that mirrors your input
-----------------------------------

In this section, we'll build a bot that mirrors or echoes your input. More specifically, the bot will respond to your input with the same message. We'll use `st.chat_message` to display the user's input and `st.chat_input` to accept user input. We'll also use [session state](/develop/concepts/architecture/session-state) to store the chat history so we can display it in the chat message container.

First, let's think about the different components we'll need to build our bot:

* Two chat message containers to display messages from the user and the bot, respectively.
* A chat input widget so the user can type in a message.
* A way to store the chat history so we can display it in the chat message containers. We can use a list to store the messages, and append to it every time the user or bot sends a message. Each entry in the list will be a dictionary with the following keys: `role` (the author of the message), and `content` (the message content).

`import streamlit as st
st.title("Echo Bot")
# Initialize chat history
if "messages" not in st.session_state:
st.session_state.messages = []
# Display chat messages from history on app rerun
for message in st.session_state.messages:
with st.chat_message(message["role"]):
st.markdown(message["content"])`

In the above snippet, we've added a title to our app and a for loop to iterate through the chat history and display each message in the chat message container (with the author role and message content). We've also added a check to see if the `messages` key is in `st.session_state`. If it's not, we initialize it to an empty list. This is because we'll be adding messages to the list later on, and we don't want to overwrite the list every time the app reruns.

Now let's accept user input with `st.chat_input`, display the user's message in the chat message container, and add it to the chat history.

`# React to user input
if prompt := st.chat_input("What is up?"):
# Display user message in chat message container
with st.chat_message("user"):
st.markdown(prompt)
# Add user message to chat history
st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": prompt})`

We used the `:=` operator to assign the user's input to the `prompt` variable and checked if it's not `None` in the same line. If the user has sent a message, we display the message in the chat message container and append it to the chat history.

All that's left to do is add the chatbot's responses within the `if` block. We'll use the same logic as before to display the bot's response (which is just the user's prompt) in the chat message container and add it to the history.

`response = f"Echo: {prompt}"
# Display assistant response in chat message container
with st.chat_message("assistant"):
st.markdown(response)
# Add assistant response to chat history
st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response})`

Putting it all together, here's the full code for our simple chatbot GUI and the result:

st.title("Echo Bot")
# Initialize chat history
if "messages" not in st.session_state:
st.session_state.messages = []
# Display chat messages from history on app rerun
for message in st.session_state.messages:
with st.chat_message(message["role"]):
st.markdown(message["content"])
# React to user input
if prompt := st.chat_input("What is up?"):
# Display user message in chat message container
st.chat_message("user").markdown(prompt)
# Add user message to chat history
st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": prompt})
response = f"Echo: {prompt}"
# Display assistant response in chat message container
with st.chat_message("assistant"):
st.markdown(response)
# Add assistant response to chat history
st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response})`
[Built with Streamlit ðŸŽˆ](https://streamlit.io)[Fullscreen *open\_in\_new*](https://doc-chat-echo.streamlit.app/?utm_medium=oembed)

While the above example is very simple, it's a good starting point for building more complex conversational apps. Notice how the bot responds instantly to your input. In the next section, we'll add a delay to simulate the bot "thinking" before responding.

Build a simple chatbot GUI with streaming
-----------------------------------------

In this section, we'll build a simple chatbot GUI that responds to user input with a random message from a list of pre-determind responses. In the [next section](#build-a-chatgpt-like-app), we'll convert this simple toy example into a ChatGPT-like experience using OpenAI.

Just like previously, we still require the same components to build our chatbot. Two chat message containers to display messages from the user and the bot, respectively. A chat input widget so the user can type in a message. And a way to store the chat history so we can display it in the chat message containers.

Let's just copy the code from the previous section and add a few tweaks to it.

`import streamlit as st
import random
import time
st.title("Simple chat")
# Initialize chat history
if "messages" not in st.session_state:
st.session_state.messages = []
# Display chat messages from history on app rerun
for message in st.session_state.messages:
with st.chat_message(message["role"]):
st.markdown(message["content"])
# Accept user input
if prompt := st.chat_input("What is up?"):
# Display user message in chat message container
with st.chat_message("user"):
st.markdown(prompt)
# Add user message to chat history
st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": prompt})`

The only difference so far is we've changed the title of our app and added imports for `random` and `time`. We'll use `random` to randomly select a response from a list of responses and `time` to add a delay to simulate the chatbot "thinking" before responding.

All that's left to do is add the chatbot's responses within the `if` block. We'll use a list of responses and randomly select one to display. We'll also add a delay to simulate the chatbot "thinking" before responding (or stream its response). Let's make a helper function for this and insert it at the top of our app.

`# Streamed response emulator
def response_generator():
response = random.choice(
[
"Hello there! How can I assist you today?",
"Hi, human! Is there anything I can help you with?",
"Do you need help?",
]
)
for word in response.split():
yield word + " "
time.sleep(0.05)`

Back to writing the response in our chat interface, we'll use `st.write_stream` to write out the streamed response with a typewriter effect.

`# Display assistant response in chat message container
with st.chat_message("assistant"):
response = st.write_stream(response_generator())
# Add assistant response to chat history
st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response})`

Above, we've added a placeholder to display the chatbot's response. We've also added a for loop to iterate through the response and display it one word at a time. We've added a delay of 0.05 seconds between each word to simulate the chatbot "thinking" before responding. Finally, we append the chatbot's response to the chat history. As you've probably guessed, this is a naive implementation of streaming. We'll see how to implement streaming with OpenAI in the [next section](#build-a-chatgpt-like-app).

Putting it all together, here's the full code for our simple chatbot GUI and the result:

View full code*expand\_more*`import streamlit as st
import random
import time
# Streamed response emulator
def response_generator():
response = random.choice(
[
"Hello there! How can I assist you today?",
"Hi, human! Is there anything I can help you with?",
"Do you need help?",
]
)
for word in response.split():
yield word + " "
time.sleep(0.05)
st.title("Simple chat")
# Initialize chat history
if "messages" not in st.session_state:
st.session_state.messages = []
# Display chat messages from history on app rerun
for message in st.session_state.messages:
with st.chat_message(message["role"]):
st.markdown(message["content"])
# Accept user input
if prompt := st.chat_input("What is up?"):
# Add user message to chat history
st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": prompt})
# Display user message in chat message container
with st.chat_message("user"):
st.markdown(prompt)
# Display assistant response in chat message container
with st.chat_message("assistant"):
response = st.write_stream(response_generator())
# Add assistant response to chat history
st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response})`
[Built with Streamlit ðŸŽˆ](https://streamlit.io)[Fullscreen *open\_in\_new*](https://doc-chat-simple.streamlit.app/?utm_medium=oembed)

Play around with the above demo to get a feel for what we've built. It's a very simple chatbot GUI, but it has all the components of a more sophisticated chatbot. In the next section, we'll see how to build a ChatGPT-like app using OpenAI.

Build a ChatGPT-like app
------------------------

Now that you've understood the basics of Streamlit's chat elements, let's make a few tweaks to it to build our own ChatGPT-like app. You'll need to install the [OpenAI Python library](https://pypi.org/project/openai/) and get an [API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to follow along.

### Install dependencies

First let's install the dependencies we'll need for this section:

`pip install openai streamlit`
### Add OpenAI API key to Streamlit secrets

Next, let's add our OpenAI API key to [Streamlit secrets](/develop/concepts/connections/secrets-management). We do this by creating `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file in our project directory and adding the following lines to it:

`# .streamlit/secrets.toml
OPENAI_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"`
### Write the app

Now let's write the app. We'll use the same code as before, but we'll replace the list of responses with a call to the OpenAI API. We'll also add a few more tweaks to make the app more ChatGPT-like.

`import streamlit as st
from openai import OpenAI
st.title("ChatGPT-like clone")
# Set OpenAI API key from Streamlit secrets
client = OpenAI(api_key=st.secrets["OPENAI_API_KEY"])
# Set a default model
if "openai_model" not in st.session_state:
st.session_state["openai_model"] = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
# Initialize chat history
if "messages" not in st.session_state:
st.session_state.messages = []
# Display chat messages from history on app rerun
for message in st.session_state.messages:
with st.chat_message(message["role"]):
st.markdown(message["content"])
# Accept user input
if prompt := st.chat_input("What is up?"):
# Add user message to chat history
st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": prompt})
# Display user message in chat message container
with st.chat_message("user"):
st.markdown(prompt)`

All that's changed is that we've added a default model to `st.session_state` and set our OpenAI API key from Streamlit secrets. Here's where it gets interesting. We can replace our emulated stream with the model's responses from OpenAI:

 `# Display assistant response in chat message container
with st.chat_message("assistant"):
stream = client.chat.completions.create(
model=st.session_state["openai_model"],
messages=[
{"role": m["role"], "content": m["content"]}
for m in st.session_state.messages
],
stream=True,
)
response = st.write_stream(stream)
st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response})`

Above, we've replaced the list of responses with a call to [`OpenAI().chat.completions.create`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation/chat-completions-api). We've set `stream=True` to stream the responses to the frontend. In the API call, we pass the model name we hardcoded in session state and pass the chat history as a list of messages. We also pass the `role` and `content` of each message in the chat history. Finally, OpenAI returns a stream of responses (split into chunks of tokens), which we iterate through and display each chunk.

Putting it all together, here's the full code for our ChatGPT-like app and the result:

import streamlit as st

client = OpenAI(api_key=st.secrets["OPENAI_API_KEY"])

st.session_state["openai_model"] = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
if "messages" not in st.session_state:
st.session_state.messages = []
for message in st.session_state.messages:

st.markdown(message["content"])
if prompt := st.chat_input("What is up?"):
st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": prompt})

stream = client.chat.completions.create(
model=st.session_state["openai_model"],

for m in st.session_state.messages
],
stream=True,
)
response = st.write_stream(stream)
st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response})`![](/images/knowledge-base/chatgpt-clone.gif)

Configure a page for st.navigation in a multipage app.

Call st.Page to initialize a StreamlitPage object, and pass it to
st.navigation to declare a page in your app.

When a user navigates to a page, st.navigation returns the selected
StreamlitPage object. Call .run() on the returned StreamlitPage
object to execute the page. You can only run the page returned by
st.navigation, and you can only run it once per app rerun.

A page can be defined by a Python file or Callable. Python files used
as a StreamlitPage source will have \_\_name\_\_ == "\_\_page\_\_".
Functions used as a StreamlitPage source will have \_\_name\_\_
corresponding to the module they were imported from. Only the entrypoint
file and functions defined within the entrypoint file have
\_\_name\_\_ == "\_\_main\_\_" to adhere to Python convention.

| Function signature[[source]](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/1.41.0/lib/streamlit/navigation/page.py#L29 "View st.Page source code on GitHub") | |
| --- | --- |
| st.Page(page, \*, title=None, icon=None, url\_path=None, default=False) | |
| Parameters | |
| page (str, Path, or callable) | The page source as a Callable or path to a Python file. If the page source is defined by a Python file, the path can be a string or pathlib.Path object. Paths can be absolute or relative to the entrypoint file. If the page source is defined by a Callable, the Callable can't accept arguments. |
| title (str or None) | The title of the page. If this is None (default), the page title (in the browser tab) and label (in the navigation menu) will be inferred from the filename or callable name in page. For more information, see [Overview of multipage apps](https://docs.streamlit.io/st.page.automatic-page-labels). |
| icon (str or None) | An optional emoji or icon to display next to the page title and label. If icon is None (default), no icon is displayed next to the page label in the navigation menu, and a Streamlit icon is displayed next to the title (in the browser tab). If icon is a string, the following options are valid:   * A single-character emoji. For example, you can set icon="ðŸš¨"    or icon="ðŸ”¥". Emoji short codes are not supported. * An icon from the Material Symbols library (rounded style) in the    format ":material/icon\_name:" where "icon\_name" is the name   of the icon in snake case.  For example, icon=":material/thumb\_up:" will display the   Thumb Up icon. Find additional icons in the [Material Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Symbols&icon.style=Rounded)   font library. |
| url\_path (str or None) | The page's URL pathname, which is the path relative to the app's root URL. If this is None (default), the URL pathname will be inferred from the filename or callable name in page. For more information, see [Overview of multipage apps](https://docs.streamlit.io/st.page.automatic-page-urls).  The default page will have a pathname of "", indicating the root URL of the app. If you set default=True, url\_path is ignored. url\_path can't include forward slashes; paths can't include subdirectories. |
| default (bool) | Whether this page is the default page to be shown when the app is loaded. If default is False (default), the page will have a nonempty URL pathname. However, if no default page is passed to st.navigation and this is the first page, this page will become the default page. If default is True, then the page will have an empty pathname and url\_path will be ignored. |
| Returns | |
| --- | --- |
| (StreamlitPage) | The page object associated to the given script. |

#### Example

> ```
> 
> import streamlit as st
> 
> def page2():
>     st.title("Second page")
> 
> pg = st.navigation([
>     st.Page("page1.py", title="First page", icon="ðŸ”¥"),
>     st.Page(page2, title="Second page", icon=":material/favorite:"),
> ])
> pg.run()
> 
> ```

| [run](/develop/api-reference/navigation/st.page#stpagerun)() | Execute the page. |
| Attributes | |
| icon (str) | The icon of the page.  If no icon was declared in st.Page, this property returns "". |
| title (str) | The title of the page.  Unless declared otherwise in st.Page, the page title is inferred from the filename or callable name. For more information, see [Overview of multipage apps](https://docs.streamlit.io/st.page.automatic-page-labels). |
| url\_path (str) | The page's URL pathname, which is the path relative to the app's root URL.  Unless declared otherwise in st.Page, the URL pathname is inferred from the filename or callable name. For more information, see [Overview of multipage apps](https://docs.streamlit.io/st.page.automatic-page-urls).  The default page will always have a url\_path of "" to indicate the root URL (e.g. homepage). |

Execute the page.

When a page is returned by st.navigation, use the .run() method
within your entrypoint file to render the page. You can only call this
method on the page returned by st.navigation. You can only call
this method once per run of your entrypoint file.
